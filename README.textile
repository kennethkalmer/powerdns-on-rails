h1. PowerDNS on Rails

PowerDNS on Rails is a Ruby on Rails application made to manage "PowerDNS":http://www.powerdns.com
installations using the generic MySQL/PostgreSQL backends.

More information:

* The README (this file)
* "Home page":http://www.opensourcery.co.za/powerdns-on-rails
* "Bug tracker":http://kennethkalmer.lighthouseapp.com/projects/11831-powerdns-on-rails

h2. Overview

The PowerDNS on Rails README is located in doc/README_FOR_APP, other supporting
documents are also located in doc/

PowerDNS on Rails is written in Ruby, using the Ruby on Rails framework. All
external dependencies have been bundled inside this project to ease the 
installation and use of the code by system administrators.

h2. Features (current and planned)

* RESTful architecture to support a rich UI and API's
* Multi-user support (admins, owners, API clients)
* CLI clients to show integration capabilities
* Conversion and import tools
* Zone/Record Templates
* DNS Insight
* Full audit record of all changes

h2. Overview

PowerDNS on Rails is a split from the BIND DLZ on Rails project.

PowerDNS is a reliable alternative to BIND and sports a flexible, feature rich
design and support for various backends, including MySQL and PostgreSQL. This 
simplifies the management of thousands of zones, and provides added redundancy 
(by way of database replication) and opens the doors for web frontends that ease
this even more.

PowerDNS on Rails is built based on our experience of managing thousands of DNS
records through various (often crude) techniques, that included building zone
files from databases via cron, and implementing PowerDNS for its database
backends.

We first built BIND DLZ on Rails that allowed us to migrate back to BIND using
a MySQL 5.0 backend, but after several failed production runs we decided to
split the project off to use our existing PowerDNS infrastructure.  Using Rails 
2 for a interface just makes sense because we can build a rich interface and an
REST API in a single go. We have a lot of integration needs, and this was our 
main driver.

h2. PowerDNS Information

The PowerDNS project can be found at http://www.powerdns.com. The documentation
is in-depth on that site, I won't repeat anything here unless its related to 
this project specifically.

It is however worth noting that this interface excepts the "Generic MySQL and
PgSQL backend" to be used, as per 
http://doc.powerdns.com/generic-mypgsql-backends.html

h2. Database Structure

PowerDNS does not allow you to alter the database schema at all, and you're 
forced to use at least one set database table. It can however handle additions
to the table without problems.

We also add additional table to accomodate users, templates, etc.

h2. Migration to PowerDNS

PowerDNS does provide a suite of migration tools, and they're all covered in the
official documentation.

h2. Testing

PowerDNS on Rails is built using extensive RSpec suites, often termed "Behaviour
Driven Development". It is critical for a core service like DNS to be reliable
and that all changes are correct and won't impact services offered to clients.

Apart from the extensive programmatic tests, we'll be implementing tests that
actually seed a DNS database and use BIND's dig utility to query a configured
PowerDNS installation.
